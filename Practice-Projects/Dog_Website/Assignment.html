		<h1> Great Danes are the best. </h1>
		<p>
		<h3> I know this from firsthand experience. </h3>
		<p> According to the American Kennel Club:
		<blockquote cite=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/great-dane/.html>
			​No one is quite sure how or why Great Danes, a German breed, came to be associated with Denmark. (In Germany they’re known as the Deutsche Dog, or “German dog.”) We do know that once upon a time, German nobles used Danes to hunt ferocious wild boars. Later, Danes became famous as protectors of their home and loved ones, a job they are still happy to perform.
