# HTML and CSS Projects
These are some sample websites I created using HTML and CSS.

## Projects:

- [Portfolio Website](http://www.lemierecs.com)
- [Music Website](https://www.github.com/ericlemiere/html-and-css-projects/Music-Website/Music-Website.html)
- [Theater Website](https://www.github.com/ericlemiere/html-and-css-projects/Theater-Project/theater-project.html)


### Portfolio Website:
This one-page website is for my programming portfolio and will be updated periodically.

### Music Website:
This page is an example site for my music work.

### Theater Website:
This is an example home page for a local theater. The site was styled using Bootstrap 4 and contains many Bootstrap elements, including navbar, jumbotron, forms, and cards.
